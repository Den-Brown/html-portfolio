<h3>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.</h3>
<p>Harry and his friends go monster and secret hunting, much to the delight of Tom Riddle, whom is a living memory in control of a massive snake.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.</h3>
<p>Harry and his friends sort of go monster and secret hunting again! This time though he meets his Godfather, who was mistaken for a monster or Grim and he also meets an actual monster (werewolf) who turned out to be a lovely, chocolate chomping teacher.</p>
